# Fraud-detection-Case-Study
This was a two-day case-study with the goal of detecting fraud event listing on a new e-commerce website to weed out fraudsters.

Predicted whether an event from an e-commerce site was fraudulent, based on 50+ features per event. Used logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest classifier models to improve prediction recall and precision.
